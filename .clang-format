# --- Spacing & Empty Lines (The Fix) ---
# This allows the empty line at the start of functions:
# int func() {
#
#    int var = 0;
# }
KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: true

# This stops it from collapsing multiple empty lines into zero.
# It ensures your manual spacing after 'if' statements is respected.
MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 2

# This forces an empty line before 'public/private', 'namespace', etc.
